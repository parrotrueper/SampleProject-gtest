# skeleton CMAKE Ninja Googletest with Docker.

This is a skeleton project for CMAKE, Ninja and Googletest using a Docker container
to provide the toolchain.

This repository is only for the project.
The Docker container for the toolchain is here: 
https://github.com/parrotrueper/googletest-container

## Dependencies

Build the Docker container gtest built here:

https://github.com/parrotrueper/googletest-container

clone this somewhere in your system and build the container

## Clone where your sources live

Then wherever you want your project to live, clone this repo

Inside your project tree clone the googletest repo

```
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
```
## Bash history

Add in a file so that bash history can be used in the Docker container.

```
